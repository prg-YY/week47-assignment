 why JavaScript needs the parentheses in thiscase?

 In JavaScript, the functions wrapped with parenthesis are called
  â€œImmediately Invoked Function Expressions" or "Self Executing Functions.
The purpose of wrapping is to namespace and control the visibility of member functions. 
It wraps code inside a function scope and decrease clashing with other libraries.
 This is what we call Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) or Self Executing Anonymous Function.
